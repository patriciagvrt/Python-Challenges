# Write a program that reads a young person's birth year and informs them, based on their age:
#
# - If they still have time before enlisting in military service.
# - If it is time to enlist.
# - If they have already passed the enlistment period.
#
# The program should also display the time remaining or how long it has been since the enlistment deadline.
